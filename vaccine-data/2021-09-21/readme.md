## Notes:

Numbers include all records entered as at 21/09/2021 11:59PM

Date extracted 22/09/2021

Data is based on records entered into CIR as at the time of data upload

DHB of residence is based on the primary residential address MoH has for the individual mapped to the DHB zones.

DHB of Residence being Overseas and Undefined is a grouped category that includes all those that normally reside overseas as well as those where we do not have a residential address on record

Other sites refers to nationally led programmes, e.g. NZDF, NZPolice, St John etc.

Where a number is less than 5, the record is suppressed to protect individual privacy, as a result, totals of individual records may not sum to gross figures.

## Files:

### &quot;cumulative\_planned\_administered\_stock&quot;

- The information provided in the vaccinations planned column is based on DHB plans.
- The last week of actuals is a partial week.
- There will be no production plans from 30 August to 3 October.  The increased vaccination demand caused by the August 2021 outbreak means the plans collected earlier do not provide a good comparator.

### &quot;dhb\_plan&quot;

- The information provided in this table is based on DHB plans. We anticipate that there could be a potential variance of up to ten percent (plus or minus) in actual vaccination numbers. This is on the basis that, for example, an unplanned significant event could affect roll-out implementation or some DHBs might exceed their planned vaccination numbers.
- There will be no production plans from 30 August to 3 October. The increased vaccination demand caused by the August 2021 outbreak means the plans collected earlier do not provide a good comparator.

### &quot;dhb\_plan\_variance&quot;

- There will be no production plans from 30 August to 3 October. The increased vaccination demand caused by the August 2021 outbreak means the plans collected earlier do not provide a good comparator.

### &quot;dhb\_residence\_uptake&quot;

- DHB of residence refers to the DHB where the individual resides, not the DHB where the vaccination was administered.
- Where a number is less than 5, the record is suppressed to protect individual privacy, as a result, totals of individual records may not sum to gross figures.
- The uptake statistics are provided as examples of how to calculate uptake. It is not recommended to use detailed uptake statistics for analysis because small variations will lead to very high or low uptakes with a small denominator. Detailed data is provided here to allow aggregations to be done across various dimensions.

### &quot;workforce&quot;

- The figures are cumulative.
- Previously, the active vaccinators number was reported as number active for a given week.

### &quot;doses\_group\_and\_dhb\_service&quot;

- DHB of service refers to the DHB where the vaccination was administered, not the DHB where the individual resides.
- Where a number is less than 5, the record is suppressed to protect individual privacy, as a result, totals of individual records may not sum to gross figures.
- Groups:

Group 1:

- Border Workers and their Household Contacts

Group 2:

- Frontline health workers. Emergency Response Services.
- Residential Facility Worker or Resident, Unknown, Other, Early Vaccine Access.
- Individuals vaccinated at NZDF sites who identify as Border Workers or Household contacts.
- Individuals over 65 and with underlying health conditions in Counties Manukau.

Group 3:

- People at greatest risk of serious illness which includes over 65s and those with underlying health conditions. Health and social services.

Group 4:

- General population.
- Group 4 has not officially commenced however a number of sites are using group 4 to minimise wastage and vaccinate whanau who attend with group 3 individuals.
- There also may be instances of vaccinators are entering group 4 into the system as the case reason when the person is eligible for group 3.

Groups 1 and 2 are based primarily on employment role. Reliable and up to date statistical information does not exist for this grouping so a population size cannot be provided.

Group 3 eligibility can be met through age or through a number of eligible health conditions and disabilities. A complete dataset of the population with relevant conditions is not available with the level of detail and quality required to define the population accurately.

###

### &quot;vaccine\_for\_distribution&quot;

- Vaccine available for distribution is stock (in doses) held at central warehouses.
- It does not include stock in transit or available at sites ready for use.

### &quot;hsu\_population&quot;

- DHB of residence refers to the DHB where the individual resides, not the DHB where the vaccination was administered .
- Where a number is less than 5, the record is suppressed to protect individual privacy, as a result, totals of individual records may not sum to gross figures. These values have been summed into a single row with the header &quot;Various&quot;

**The Health Service User (HSU) population and COVID-19 vaccine coverage reporting**

The Health Service User population estimate counts the number of people who received health services in a given year. Someone is counted in the population if their associated National Health Index (NHI) number received public health services; or was enrolled with a primary health organisation (PHO).

**Information on the HSU 2020 used for COVID-19 vaccine coverage reporting**

- The HSU population estimate was generated from data on 5th July 2021 and captures health service users in the 2020 calendar year.
- The HSU population estimate uses 1 July 2020 to set age, and anyone who died prior to 1st July 2020 is excluded from the population, while anyone who has died from 1 July onwards is included.
- DHB of domicile was captured on 31 December 2020 as the latest address information we have for the individual.
- Ethnicity and gender information comes from the NHI status at 5th July 2021.
- Children under the age of 12 years have been excluded from the count, as there is currently no approval to vaccinate these ages.
- Ethnicity is prioritised in the order: Māori, Pacific, Asian, European or Other, Unknown
- Approximately 3-4% of people included in the HSU were not enrolled with a PHO but had a record of health service use.

**Benefits of the HSU**

**Preventing numerator denominator bias.** To monitor COVID-19 vaccine coverage, the HSU is being used as a health-specific population denominator. The HSU ensures the same source of demographic information is used in the numerator and the denominator. This combats numerator denominator bias. There are some drawbacks to this (see below), but the HSU will provide the most accurate analysis of vaccine coverage by ethnicity and location.

_Analysis of uptake by ethnicity. _The ethnicity with which someone identifies in the Census is not always the same as their ethnicity as recorded in health data: approximately 15-20% of people who self-identified as Māori or Pacific in the 2018 Census were not recorded as Māori or Pacific in NHI data in 2020. This means that when using Census-based estimates (eg Stats NZ population estimates or projections) as the population denominator, and health data as the numerator, mismatches in ethnicity occur. For vaccine uptake monitoring purposes, this would mean the ethnic specific vaccine uptake rates would be incorrect.

_Analysis of uptake by location. _When using the HSU the source of health service users&#39; address information, from which location information is derived, is also the same in the numerator and the denominator. This allows for more accurate and flexible analysis of coverage by geography. From a vaccine perspective, this is very helpful in assisting DHBs and PHOs to monitor the populations for which they are responsible. It also enables the identification of potential geographic clusters with low vaccine coverage.

**Available for a wide range of sub-populations.** As the HSU is based on health data, it can be aggregated by any variable held in health data. For example, prioritised or total response ethnicity at level 1 or level 2; a range of geographic areas including domicile code, TLA, and meshblock; NZDep quintile or decile. Other National-level population estimates have a more limited range of demographic variables included, reducing their usefulness for vaccine coverage monitoring of various sub-populations.

**Limitations of the HSU**

**The HSU does not include everyone in New Zealand.** By definition, the HSU _is not a total population estimate_: it includes people who received health services or were PHO enrolled in a given year. This does not cover everyone in New Zealand. The HSU is likely to miss highly marginalised groups. Also, the datasets used to create the HSU are not always complete, for example we do not receive complete reporting of all private hospital events in New Zealand.

This means that some groups are underrepresented in the HSU. Analysis done in the Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI) suggests that groups underrepresented in the HSU include young people aged 15-45 years (men in particular), and people of Asian and MELAA ethnicity. Using the HSU as a denominator could overestimate vaccine coverage for some of these groups.

For some sub-populations, more people may receive a vaccine than expected based on the total number of people in that sub-population of health service users in 2020, as some people who did not engage with health services in 2020 will receive a COVID-19 vaccine. This means coverage rates can exceed 100%.

**The HSU includes some people who are no longer in New Zealand.** People who left New Zealand to go overseas and were still enrolled with a PHO in 2020 are counted in the HSU for 2020. PHOs are required to follow up with people enrolled if they have had no contact in the previous three years. MoH also does not receive information about people who die overseas. This means the HSU will continue to count people in the population who have died overseas until their PHO enrolment lapses. This is a particular issue for some communities, who may be more likely to return to their country of birth in their later years. If a person moving overseas didn&#39;t notify their PHO of their move, they will be included in the HSU.

The HSU also includes some people who came to New Zealand as overseas visitors and used health services during their stay. There are several variables in our data which indicate if people are overseas visitors, but these are not complete, and will miss some overseas visitors.

This means that the HSU may somewhat underestimate vaccine coverage for some population sub-groups, as they are counted in the HSU denominator, but are no longer in New Zealand to receive their vaccine.

**Other information**

- The HSU population estimate data is provided at a granular level in order to allow flexibility in creating different aggregate denominators.  It is not recommended to use detailed denominators for analysis because small variations will lead to very high or low uptakes with a small denominator.
- As the HSU population estimate is based on real individuals, some figures have been aggregated in slightly different ways when publishing to protect individual privacy.  This may mean Ministry of Health reporting may produce slightly different uptake results than those using the published HSU population estimate.

**Contributing datasets**

The MoH collections used to create the HSU are: the National Enrolment Service (NES), the National Health Index (NHI), the National Minimum Dataset (NMDS, hospital discharge information); the National Non-Admitted Patient Collection, which includes ED visits (NNPAC); publicly funded laboratory tests undertaken in a community laboratory (LABS); publicly funded pharmaceuticals dispensing; the Programme for the Integration of Mental Health data  (PRIMHD, mental health service use); the National Mortality collection; the National Maternity collection; the General Medical Subsidy (GMS); and the National Immunisation Register (NIR).
