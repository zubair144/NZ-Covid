_The data and maps for vaccine uptake by SA2 is in beta and are in development. Further improvements are expected._

### uptake_sa2_dhb_yyyymmdd.csv

Information related to uptake rates of the COVID-19 vaccine across the country. Data shows vaccination records aggregated by area of residence. The areas have been determined based on the standard SA2 definition from Statistics NZ. Population (denominator data) is based on the Health Service User data set, and is sourced from NHI records held by the Ministry of Health. In this data, the denominator data set has been updated with the most up to date place of residence and as a result will differ slightly from the published HSU at disaggregated levels.

### uptake_sa2_dhb_maori_yyyymmdd.csv
Information related to uptake rates of the COVID-19 vaccine within MƒÅori communities across New Zealand. Data shows vaccination records aggregated by area of residence. The areas have been determined based on the standard SA2 definition from Statistics NZ. In this data, the denominator data set has been updated with the most up to date place of residence and as a result will differ slightly from the published HSU at disaggregated levels.

### uptake_sa2_dhb_pacific_yyyymmdd.csv
Information related to uptake rates of the COVID-19 vaccine within Pacific communities across New Zealand. Data shows vaccination records aggregated by area of residence. The areas have been determined based on the standard SA2 definition from Statistics NZ.  Population (denominator data) and ethnicity data is based on the Health Service User data set, and is sourced from NHI records held by the Ministry of Health. In this data, the denominator data set has been updated with the most up to date place of residence and as a result will differ slightly from the published HSU at disaggregated levels.

### Caveats
- Unless stated otherwise, definitions used in this data are as set out on the COVID-19: Vaccine Data page
- Results have been suppressed in line with standard privacy procedures
- Some areas have vaccination counts that are higher than the anticipated population count due to population movements
- Records that are unable to be matched to SA2 location details are not shown on the maps and are listed as _Unknown_ in the data file

### Notes

- Reported rates are doses per thousand population
